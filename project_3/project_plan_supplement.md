# Project III - Supplementary Plan: GAN Implementation and Missing Requirements

This document supplements the main project plan by adding GAN as a second generative method and addressing missing requirements from the project instruction.

## 1. GAN Implementation (Second Method)

### Why GANs as Second Method
- Provides a strong contrast to diffusion models in architecture and training dynamics
- Well-established baseline for image generation tasks
- Different failure modes (mode collapse) that need specific handling
- Faster inference time compared to diffusion models

### GAN Architecture: StyleGAN2-ADA

We choose StyleGAN2-ADA (Adaptive Discriminator Augmentation) for the following reasons:
1. State-of-the-art quality for small dataset training
2. Built-in augmentation pipeline crucial for limited data
3. Addresses mode collapse through improved training stability
4. Well-documented implementation available

#### Generator Architecture
- Mapping network: 8 layers, 512 hidden units
- Synthesis network: Progressive growing from 4x4 to 256x256
- Style modulation at each layer
- Noise injection for stochastic variation
- Skip connections and normalization

#### Discriminator Architecture
- Residual architecture with downsampling
- Minibatch standard deviation layer
- Adaptive augmentation pipeline:
  - Geometric: translation, rotation, isotropic scaling
  - Color: brightness, contrast, saturation, hue
  - Filter: blur, noise, cutout

### Training Strategy
1. **Two-stage training**:
   - Stage 1: Train at 128x128 resolution for faster iteration
   - Stage 2: Fine-tune at 256x256 resolution

2. **Hyperparameters to investigate**:
   - Learning rates (G: 0.002, D: 0.002 with different ratios)
   - R1 regularization strength (γ = 10, 50, 100)
   - Augmentation probability (p = 0.0 to 0.8)
   - Batch size impact (4, 8, 16 within memory constraints)

## 2. Addressing Mode Collapse

### Detection Strategy
1. **Inception Score (IS) monitoring**: Track IS every 1000 iterations
2. **Mode coverage analysis**: 
   - Generate 1000 samples periodically
   - Cluster using pre-trained features
   - Monitor number of active clusters
3. **Discriminator overfitting detection**:
   - Track D_real and D_fake scores
   - Alert if D_fake approaches 0 while D_real approaches 1

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **For GANs**:
   - Increase augmentation probability dynamically
   - Adjust learning rate ratio (slow down D, speed up G)
   - Add noise to discriminator inputs
   - Use exponential moving average for generator weights

2. **For Diffusion Models** (if mode collapse detected):
   - Adjust noise schedule
   - Increase training iterations
   - Modify sampling temperature
   - Use classifier-free guidance with different scales

## 3. Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
1. **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)**
   - Primary metric for both methods
   - Compute on 10,000 generated samples
   - Use clean-fid library for consistency

2. **Inception Score (IS)**
   - Secondary metric as requested
   - Measures both quality and diversity
   - Report with confidence intervals

3. **Precision and Recall**
   - Precision: quality of generated samples
   - Recall: coverage of real data distribution
   - Uses k-nearest neighbors in feature space

4. **Mode Coverage Metrics**
   - Number of covered modes
   - KL divergence between generated and real distributions

### Qualitative Assessment Framework
1. **Visual Quality Rubric**:
   - Anatomical correctness (eyes, ears, body proportions)
   - Texture quality (fur detail, sharpness)
   - Pose diversity
   - Background coherence

2. **Human Evaluation** (if time permits):
   - Prepare evaluation interface
   - Rate realism (1-5 scale)
   - Identify obvious artifacts

## 4. Method Comparison Framework

### Systematic Comparison
1. **Training Efficiency**:
   - Time to reach FID < 50
   - GPU memory usage
   - Training stability (loss curves)

2. **Generation Quality**:
   - FID/IS scores at convergence
   - Best/worst case samples
   - Consistency across runs

3. **Computational Requirements**:
   - Training time (hours)
   - Inference time per image
   - Model size (parameters and disk space)

4. **Failure Mode Analysis**:
   - Mode collapse frequency and severity
   - Training instabilities
   - Common artifacts

## 5. Latent Space Clarification

### Diffusion Models
- No traditional "latent noise matrix"
- Interpolation approach:
  1. Encode two images to t=T noise using DDIM deterministic encoding
  2. Interpolate between these noise representations
  3. Denoise the interpolated representations
  
### GANs
- Traditional latent vector z ∈ ℝ^512
- Direct linear interpolation in z-space
- For StyleGAN2: can also interpolate in W or W+ space

## 6. Working with Limited Computing Resources

### Resource Management Strategy
1. **Progressive Resolution Training**:
   - Start at 64x64 or 128x128
   - Gradually increase to 256x256
   - Reduces memory and computation initially

2. **Mixed Precision Training**:
   - Use fp16 for forward pass
   - Keep fp32 master weights
   - 2x memory savings, 2-3x speedup

3. **Gradient Accumulation**:
   - Simulate larger batches
   - Trade computation time for memory

4. **Model Checkpointing**:
   - Save every 5000 iterations
   - Resume capabilities for long training
   - Best model selection based on FID

5. **Data Loading Optimization**:
   - Pre-resize images to target resolution
   - Use efficient data formats (WebDataset or TFRecords)
   - Multiple worker processes
   - Pin memory for GPU transfer

6. **Distributed Training** (if multiple GPUs available):
   - Data parallel training
   - Gradient synchronization strategies

## 7. Additional Findings Documentation

   - Effect of image resolution variations
